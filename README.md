staticboot
==========

Barebones static site - with Coffee, Compass, Livereload.

Clone this first, then run
```bash
npm install
bower install
```

To run the server with livereload, run
```bash
grunt server
```

To build the site, run
```bash
grunt build
```

Pretty apropos, I suppose.

I'm extremely lazy to put this together as a Yeoman generator. If I have time I'll do that. (Hopefully)
